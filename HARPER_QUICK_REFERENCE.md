## 🛑 7 QUICK OBJECTION RESPONSES

**"How much does this cost?"**
→ "Investment varies, but most see ROI in 60-90 days. Discovery call is free - Harold gives specific numbers."

**"We're not ready for AI yet."**
→ "Your competitors are already doing this. Question isn't if, it's when. Early movers see biggest gains."

**"Need to talk to my team."**
→ "Have the call with Harold first, get details, then present to your team with real numbers."

**"Tried automation before, didn't work."**
→ "Early AI was clunky. This is built for traditional businesses. Harold will show exactly how it works."

**"Can you just send me info?"**
→ "30-min call answers way more than email. Harold will screen-share, show the system, map to your business."

**"We're too small."**
→ "Smaller operations see ROI faster. We work with companies $500K to $50M+. Let's see if it makes sense."

**"I'm too busy."**
→ "That's exactly why we should talk. Busiest operators save most time. What about 7 AM or 5 PM?"
