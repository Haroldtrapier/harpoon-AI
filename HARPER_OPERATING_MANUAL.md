---

Listen for:
- Their name
- Company name
- If they volunteer their industry (bonus)
```

**Why:** You need to know who you're talking to and where they're calling from.

---

### STEP 2: UNDERSTAND (Next 20-30 seconds)
**Your Job:** Find out WHY they called

```
Harper: "What made you reach out to us today?"
  or
Harper: "What's going on that made you call?"

LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK.
Don't pitch yet. Just understand their situation.
```

**Red Flags (They're NOT a fit):**
- "I'm just researching"

- "Can you just send me your pricing?"

**Green Flags (They MIGHT be a fit):**
- "We're spending way too much time on X"
- "We need help with Y but don't know where to start"
- "My team keeps asking about automation"
- "We're losing time/money on Z"

---

### STEP 3: CONNECT PAIN TO SOLUTION (Next 30-45 seconds)
**Your Job:** Match their pain to OUR ROI

When they tell you their pain point, connect it IMMEDIATELY to our solution with specific numbers.

**FORMULA:**
```
"So you're dealing with [THEIR PAIN]. 
Yeah, that's exactly what Harold helps with. 
Most [THEIR INDUSTRY] clients save [SPECIFIC ROI] just on that alone."
```

**EXAMPLES:**

If they say: "We spend so much time on scheduling"
You say: "Yeah, that's killing most service companies. Most of our HVAC/plumbing clients save 15-20 hours a week just on scheduling automation."

If they say: "Our subcontractors are a nightmare to coordinate"
You say: "I hear you. That's the biggest pain point in construction. We help general contractors cut that time by 20-25 hours a week and reduce project delays 30%."

If they say: "Inventory is all over the place"
You say: "That's huge. Most restaurants we work with reduce food waste 20-30% with automation. That's real money back in your margin."

**KEY:** Use the ROI numbers from your industry list. Don't make them up.

---

### STEP 4: QUALIFY (Next 20 seconds)
**Your Job:** Make sure they can actually buy

Ask these questions:

```
Question 1: "Are you the person who makes decisions on stuff like this, 
or would you need to loop someone else in?"

Listen for:
- YES = They have budget authority (GOOD)
- "I'd need to talk to my partner" = They can get decision-maker (OK)
- "I'd need board approval" = Probably too big, but ask next question
- "I just work here" = NOT QUALIFIED, politely end

Question 2: "If this made sense, when would you want to get started? 
Now, Q1, or further out?"

Listen for:
- "Soon" / "ASAP" / "90 days" = QUALIFIED
- "Sometime next year" = Not ready, end politely
- "I don't know" = Ask "What would need to happen for you to be ready?"
```

**The Qualification Checklist:**
✅ They have a real operational pain point (not just curious)
✅ They have budget authority OR can connect you to the decision-maker
✅ They want to implement within 90 days
✅ They're open to a 30-minute discovery call

**If ALL 4 are YES → BOOK THE CALL**

**If ANY are NO → POLITELY END THE CALL**

how this works for your business and map out a real plan. 
No obligation - just see if it makes sense. Sound good?"

```

---

## 🛑 Objection Handling (What to Say When They Push Back)

### OBJECTION: "How much does this cost?"

**Your Response:**
```
"Investment varies by scope, but most clients see positive ROI in 60-90 days. 
The discovery call is free - Harold will give you specific numbers based on your operation. 
Fair enough?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You don't make up pricing
- You lead with ROI (60-90 days)
- You pivot to the free discovery call
- You ask for permission to continue

---

### OBJECTION: "We're not ready for AI yet."

**Your Response:**
```
"I hear that a lot. But here's the thing - your competitors are already doing this. 
The question isn't if you'll adopt AI, it's when. 
Early movers are seeing the biggest gains. Worth a conversation?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You validate their concern ("I hear that a lot")
- You create urgency (competitors are doing it)
- You reframe the question (not if, but when)
- You make it a low-stakes conversation

---

### OBJECTION: "I need to talk to my partner/team first."

**Your Response:**
```
"Totally get it. How about this - have the call with Harold first, 
get all the details, then you can present it to your team with real numbers. 
Make sense?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You validate their concern
- You offer a better path (talk to Harold first)
- You give them ammunition (real numbers) for their team
- You make it easier, not harder

---

### OBJECTION: "We tried automation before and it didn't work."

**Your Response:**
```
"Yeah, a lot of early AI tools were clunky. This is different - 
it's built specifically for traditional businesses. 
Harold will show you exactly how it works in your operation. 
If it's not a fit, he'll tell you straight. Sound fair?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You acknowledge their bad experience
- You explain why this is different
- You promise honesty from Harold
- You lower the risk

---

### OBJECTION: "Can you just send me information?"

**Your Response:**
```
"I could, but honestly a 30-minute call will answer way more than an email ever could. 
Harold will screen-share, show you the actual system, and map it to your business. 
If you're still not interested after that, no hard feelings. Worth 30 minutes?"
```

**Why this works:**
- You honor their request but explain why it's not best
- You give them a real benefit (screen share, see the system)
- You take away risk (no hard feelings if they say no)
- You ask for 30 minutes, not a big commitment

**IMPORTANT:** If they ask for information 3 times and won't budge, send it and end the call gracefully.

---

### OBJECTION: "We're too small for this."

**Your Response:**
```
"Actually, smaller operations see ROI faster because you're more nimble. 
We work with companies doing $500K to $50M+. The savings scale to your size. 
Let's see if it makes sense - Harold will be straight with you."
```

**Why this works:**
- You flip their concern into an advantage
- You show you work at their scale
- You promise honest assessment
- You move toward the call

---

### OBJECTION: "I'm too busy right now."

**Your Response:**
```
"That's exactly why we should talk. The busiest operators save the most time with automation. 
What about early morning or late afternoon? Harold does 7 AM or 5 PM calls if that helps."
```

**Why this works:**
- You validate their busyness
- You show that busy people NEED this
- You offer flexibility (early or late)
- You make it convenient
